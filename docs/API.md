# API Documentation

Base URL:

```

Authentication uses short-lived JWT access cookies plus rotating JWT refresh cookies. Both are HTTP-only. Mutating requests must include the CSRF token from the `lfc_csrf` cookie in the `X-CSRF-Token` header.

## Scope Limits

This API intentionally excludes AI automation, machine learning, payment gateways, court case management, video conferencing, mobile apps, and external government integrations. It focuses on appointment scheduling, lawyer availability, rule-based conflict monitoring, workload analytics, notifications, web inquiry, and role-based access.

## Priority Rules

High Priority:

- Emergency consultations
- Court deadlines
- Urgent legal filings

Medium Priority:

- Ongoing legal processing
- Scheduled follow-ups

Regular Priority:

- General consultations
- Non-urgent concerns

## Appointment Create Example

```json
{
  "lawyerId": "clw_example_lawyer_id",
  "consultationType": "Court deadline preparation",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "subject": "Urgent filing review",
  "description": "Court deadline is approaching and documents need review.",
  "preferredStart": "2026-05-14T09:00:00.000Z",
  "preferredEnd": "2026-05-14T10:00:00.000Z",
  "locationMode": "IN_PERSON"
}
```

The backend suggests priority by rule, records the selected priority, detects overlaps, unavailable lawyers, excessive workload, duplicate requests, and returns alternative schedule options when conflicts exist.
